    "I really liked the reading for this week. It talked about superclasses, which have come up before, but the example in the text helped me to contextualize use cases for them as well as understand inheritance. It was also helpful when it broke down the two uses for main as (1) starting a Java application and (2) testing a real class. The explanation of a tester class was a bit confusing though. It seemed like it was a class that initialized an object from another class. I think the word \"tester\" makes me think of unit tests, so maybe that's where some of my confusion stems from. I had a class (my week seven class) where I instantiate several different classes, but I'm not completely sure if that counts as a tester class.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wound up making a lot of different classes for the (second) lab this week. This surprised me but was also a somewhat pleasant experience. I say \"somewhat\" because when it came down to instantiating my job application as a new object, it took instantiating several other objects for me to successfully create a single job application. I waffle over it in the video recording, but ultimately I wind up instantiating quite a few new objects in the week seven class. What I think I might do over spring break is take a look at some open source Java projects to try and get an understanding of how organization works on larger scale projects. Separating things out into smaller pieces feels natural to me, but bringing those pieces together inevitably winds up becoming a mess when I'm at the wheel, so I want to get better at that.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thought: I know that error handling is coming up at some point, but I'd be really interested in learning more about data validation. There were a few formatting methods I came up here that felt incredibly vulnerable without it. It also makes me curious as to what coming up with unit tests looks like in Java or what a set up for test-driven development would look like. (One of my favorite hobbies is admiring test-driven development and then never actually doing it.)"
