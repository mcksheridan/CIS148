    "The notes from this week point out that not all classes in Java need to be blueprints. (One example being the module classes we made previously.) I am so confused about what \"clean code\" looks like in Java (though you pointed out that each organization is going to have a different interpreation of what best practices are in the first place). Baeldung had a page about clean code, but I've used resources built off of Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code* in the past, so I figured I'd look at the [clean-code-java repo](https://github.com/leonardolemie/clean-code-java) on GitHub. Unfortunately, the repo wasn't complete and randomly switched to JavaScript in the middle--so back to [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-clean-code) I went. It emphasized general principles like KISS and the single responsibility principle. One thing that piqued my interest here was the \"Dependency Inversion Principle\" from SOLID. I had no idea what \"classes should only depend on abstractions and not on their concrete implementations\" meant, so I had to work on fixing that. I asked ChatGPT to explain it to me like I was five, and it still didn't completely make sense. Then, I tried asking it to give me an example of code that broke the Dependency Inversion Principle, and that was the ticket to understanding the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning about the Dependency Inversion Principle turned out to be more of a side quest than anything for this week. When it came time to do the assignment, I wanted to see if I could actually leverage Java's class-based syntax and break away from both my functional programming instinct and the more procedural way I've done previous assignments. I came up with a working solution pretty quickly with a method class but didn't feel like I was actually taking advantage of Java.\n",

    "        ArrayList<Integer> multiples = new ArrayList<>();\n",

    "        while (i < limit) {\n",
    "            if ((i % 3 == 0) || (i % 5 == 0)) {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to refactor this by creating a new \"Multiples\" class instead. (This is ultimately the solution I submitted above, but I'm still unsure if the name actually captures what the class is doing.) I think one interesting part of creating a new Multiples class was creating a method to sum numbers from an array list. I stored the multiples of three or five in an array list, so that's the data type I wanted to work with when I tallied everything up. I thought about directly accessing that `getMultiples()` method inside of `getSum()` method, but I wanted it to be more agnostic. I don't know if that actually made sense or was in any way necessary, but it was fun to think about.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, I'm walking away from this assignment feeling pleased. Even though the code I submitted wound up a bit longer than what I have above in this wiki block, it's so much more readable and less procedural after refactoring.\n",
