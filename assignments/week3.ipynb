    "I'm pretty familiar with conditions and the different types of loops, so I think a lot of what I learned this week stemmed from introducing modularity. However, before I dive into that, I did a couple of logic and condition related pieces of insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding logic, I wanted to see if it would be possible to handle invalid user input. If a user doesn't enter a double (or at least a number of some sort that Java can convert to a double), then the program encounters an error. I wanted to know if I could use a ternary operator create a fallback value (of zero) in the event that the user did try to enter something incompatible with the double type. The short answer is: no?\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Double conversionInput = sc.nextDouble();\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Double conversionInput = sc.nextDouble() ? sc.nextDouble() : 0.0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The error I got told me that my types were incompatible because I was trying to initialize a double with the value of a Boolean. I thought the existence of a value for `.nextDouble()` might make it evaluate to something that was equivalent to true or false, but I think I was thinking with my JavaScript brain. I switched things up a bit based on the feedback from the error and readjusted the statement so that it read:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Double conversionInput = sc.nextDouble() > 0 | sc.nextDouble() < 0 ? sc.nextDouble() : 0.0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But when I tried to enter the letter \"z\" as my conversion input, I still got an error. I think the conclusion here is that I'm excited to find out how to handle exceptions like these in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as conditions go, I used a switch statement in the assignment. I used it to assign a currency rate based on a currency code. Initially, I created a double and gave it the identifier of rate but didn't initialize it with a value. Later, I received a warning that my rate variable might not be defined. I wound up initializing the rate variable with a fallback value of zero, but I discovered that adding a default case to my switch statement in which I gave the rate variable a value of zero worked just as well. I'll keep that in mind the next time around.\n"

    "**How can approaching Java through a Modular Perspective enhance your coding experience in Java?**\n",
    "Modular programming can make code easier to read because individual files tend to be shorter. Grouping things into separate files with established conventions also makes it easier to return to code and find something you're looking for. Modular programming emphasizes reusability, so you can avoid repeating yourself (and accidentally making mistakes in the process), make updates to code in one place as opposed to multiple places, and avoid needing to repeat fixes for errors. Modular code is also easier to test, easier to refactor, easier to update, and easier to collaborate on."

Although it's still possible to have an infinite `for` loop, with a `while` (or `do while`) loop, you have to remember to create the structure for an intializing condition and a means of updating that condition so that it can eventually be false yourself."
