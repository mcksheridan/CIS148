    "I wanted to play around with string equality a bit, so I created two string variables and initialized them both with a value of `\"Test\"`. Comparing them using the `.equals()` method or the `==` operator both return a value of `true`. However, when I used the `.concat()` method to add additional text (`\" String\"`) at the end of both strings, only the `.equals()` method works. I then built the same `\"Test\"` string using the `StringBuilder` type. Neither the `.equals()` method nor the `==` operator returned a result of `true` this time. When I used the `.toString()` method to convert both test strings before comparing them, only the `.equals()` method worked again. Playing around with this reinforced that the `.equals()` method is actually looking at the characters that make up the string while the `==` operator is just looking at the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of my endeavors with string equality, I got really invested in the method I created for counting vowels. Early on, I decided to put my vowels into an array. (The reading doesn't do this, but I thought it might make for a fun diversion.) I wanted to ask each character in the string I was checking for vowels if it matched one of the vowels in the arrays. I knew I could do this by nesting a for loop inside of a for loop, but I knew that would have less than optimal complexity, so I wasn't too keen on that option. In JavaScript, I would have chosen to implement this with an array method that checks to see if a particular value matches the value of an element in the array. It would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {\n",
    "    if (vowels.includes(text[i])) {\n",
    "      vowelCount += 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I assumed there would be a direct equivalent in Java, but I think I was wrong. I searched for a way to check if an array includes an element and came up with some StackOverflow results. Two suggestions popped out to me: a binary search method and an as list method. The binary list method could only detect vowels when they were sorted (in the string), and I didn't necessarily want to walk down that road. I couldn't seem to get the `.asList()` method to function as I wanted it to either, and comments on StackOverflow indicated that it didn't work with primitives--the data type I was using.\n",
    "\n",
    "To supplement my StackOverflow queries, I also asked ChatGPT to rewrite the JavaScript function above into a Java class. ChatGPT also chose to create a for each loop to implement this functionality, though it did choose to create a separate method solely to determine if a character matched a vowel, which I thought was interesting."
