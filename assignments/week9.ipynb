    "The first thing I noticed when I ran the temperature converter program was that I could hardly see it. The video showed that it was hard to see, but I didn't realize just how unclear it was until I ran it myself. After adjusting the size of the window with `setSize()` (and also [minimum size](https://alvinalexander.com/java/java-set-jframe-size/)), I started to consider what layout changes I would make to create a more pleasing and intuitive user interface. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I looked up some existing applications that convert temperatures between Celsius and Farenheit, picked [a favorite](https://www.omnicalculator.com/conversion/celsius-to-fahrenheit), and decided to mimic parts of it in desktop form.\n",

    "The website I was mimicking converted seamlessly between Fahrenheit and Celsius, negating the need for an output field. This gets rid of that field and displays the result in the Fahrenheit input field created in the \"add additional labels/inputs\" commit. Exception handling happened in the output field originally, but the source I followed as inspiration handled invalid input by emptying the field where you would expect to see the conversion output. For example, if I entered \"T\" in the Celsius field, the Fahrenheit field went blank. I used this commit to copy that behavior as well.\n",
