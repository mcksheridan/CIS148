    "There was a lot of syntax to unpack this week. My favorite way to learn programming things is to get into the code and start breaking things. I followed the examples from the book a little more closely than I followed the examples from the website last week. The four functions I created were really straightforward, and that made it easier to break things apart and confirm my understanding of what did what and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "I created a `.takeCard()` method inside of a Greeter class based on the enum example of creating your own type for card suits. I tried to locally scope the enum, but discovered I couldn't as long as it was declared with the `public` keyword. Then, I realized this meant I could access the card suit enum from my Week02 class. The syntax differs from when you want to call a method by creating an instance of a class, so I struggled a bit with figuring out how to create a variable from that enum. The enum name and value name turned out a bit long, but in the end I wound up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Greeter.CardSuit myCardSuit = Greeter.CardSuit.DIAMONDS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(I think I hoped I would be able to cut out the second reference to \"Greeter.CardSuit,\" and that sent me around in circles for a bit.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't really need to access the card suit enum from the Week02 class, so I thought it would be smart to locally scope it, but my IDE errors told me that wasn't possible. I removed the `public` keyword from it next to see what would happen. It was still accessible from the Week02 class, and that's when I realized that public is the default setting. I had to declare it `private` to make my HelloApp2 produce an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "I changed a different to `static` to see what would happen. The app still compiled and ran as expected, but I did see a notice about accessing a static method. We learned during the reading that static methods are called from classes, so to make this notice disappear, all I had to do was call this static method directly from its class as opposed to from the object I instantiated from the class. I also tried calling this method inside of a different method in the Greeter class. Initially, I called it by using `Greeter.this.methodIdentifier();`, but the `this` wasn't necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digging into the `static` keyword a bit more, I noticed that when we used the scanner class, we declared it with `static`. I wanted to see what would happen if I removed this. Everything seemed to work fine, so I'm not sure what the argument for making this a class variable--as opposed to an instance variable--would be in this specific case.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I didn't really understand from the reading was `void`, so that was next up on my list of things to break. Deleting it immediately gave me an error about needing a return type declaration. The reading says that the `void` keyword means that a method doesn't return anything. Naturally, I needed to know what kind of keyword indicates that a method **does** return something, so I asked ChatGPT about it. Previously, I hadn't made the connection that the other data types (like primitives and references) were available as return types for methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided it would be fun (?) to break my `.askeAge()` method on the Greeter class. I changed its return type from `void` to `int` and returned the value of the integer the user inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    public int askAge() {\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"How old are you?\");\n",
    "        int x = sc.nextInt();\n",
    "        return x;\n",
    "//        System.out.println(\"You are \" + x + \" years old.\");\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the Week02 class, I stored the result of the call to `.askAge()` to an integer variable and then added the system output there instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        int age = myGreeterObject.askAge();\n",
    "        System.out.println(\"This is your age: \" + age);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I changed everything back because I'd rather have the `.askAge()` method handle displaying the user's age then the Week02 class, it was cool to see everything continue to work and have a better understanding of why/when to use `void`."
